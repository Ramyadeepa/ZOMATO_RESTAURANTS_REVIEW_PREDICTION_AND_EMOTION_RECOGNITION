# ZOMATO_RESTAURANTS_REVIEW_PREDICTION_AND_EMOTION_RECOGNITION

This project provides an abstractive multi-text summary method that can automatically generate template-based review summaries and sentiments (positive or negative). This method allows users to quickly grasp the positive and negative opinions of each important aspect of the restaurant. For a restaurant review, some topics like service, food quality and atmosphere are important. In order to ensure that abstracts can be generated for these essential topics using Gensim suite, our method predefines the topics that must be generated, and then generates abstracts for these topics. For recognising the review emotion Vadar is used. The results show that the method proposed in this project is superior to the other review summary and analysis methods.
